# download_file.py
#
# ICS 32 Fall 2015
# Code Example
#
# This is a short program that demonstrates how to download the contents
# of a URL from the web and save it into a file on the local hard drive.
# The program doesn't attempt to do anything interesting with the file;
# it saves whatever the web server sends back into the file, without
# regard to what it is, formatting concerns, or anything else; it is
# what it is.
#
# One thing that appears here that does not appear in the write-up
# accompanying this example is the use of the urllib.error.HTTPError
# exception, which is raised by urllib.request.urlopen() whenever an
# attempt to download a web page fails (e.g., because you try to
# download a page that does not exist).  When that exception is raised,
# you can catch it and use its code attribute to determine what status
# code the server returned (e.g., 404 means that the page was not found,
# i.e., that it doesn't exist).
